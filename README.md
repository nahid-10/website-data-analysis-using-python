 Channel group performance (users, sessions, engagement rate)

 Engagement metrics: engaged vs. non-engaged sessions

 Bounce rate and session duration visualization

 Clean and modular Python code using Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

channel_group: Source of traffic (e.g., Organic, Paid, Referral)

users: Number of users from that channel

sessions: Total sessions

avg_engagement_time: Average time spent on site (in seconds)

engagement_rate: % of sessions with meaningful interactions

datetime: Timestamp (used for time series analysis)



🧠 Insights Discovered

1.Which channel drives the most users

2.Which channel has the highest engagement time

3.Daily trends in user traffic

4.User behavior differences across channels

5.Ratio of engaged vs non-engaged sessions
